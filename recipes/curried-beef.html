	    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
	    <ul>
		<li>1/2 pound beef for stew, such as beef chuck roast, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
		<li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
		<li>2 (3 inch) pieces fresh ginger root, peeled and diced</li>
		<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 onions, peeled and diced</li>
		<li>2 celery ribs, chopped</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons curry powder, or to taste</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons coriander powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon Asian five-spice powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
		<li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
		<li>parsnips, peeled and sliced</li>
		<li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
		<li>1 zucchini, sliced</li>
		<li>2 apples - peeled, cored and chopped</li>
		<li>1 cup raisins</li>
		<li>1 cup cashews</li>
		<li>1/2 cup water</li>
	    </ul>

	    <h2>Steps</h2>
	    <ol id="steps">
		<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with aluminum foil.</li>
		<li>Place the beef into a pan with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. </li>
		<li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a deep pot over medium-high heat. Stir in the ginger, garlic, onions, and celery, and cook until vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Mix in the curry powder, coriander powder, five-spice powder, and turmeric, and toss to evenly coat the onion mixture. Cook about 5 minutes more, and stir in the carrots, parsnips, potatoes, zucchini, and apples. Stir in the beef with its cooking liquid, raisins, and cashews, and toss to evenly blend the spices.</li>
		<li>Pour the beef and vegetable mixture into the prepared roasting pan. Drizzle 1/2 cup water over the mixture. Cover the pan with aluminum foil. </li>
		<li>Bake in preheated oven until heated through, about 1 hour.</li>
