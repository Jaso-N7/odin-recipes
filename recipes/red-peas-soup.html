	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	    A thick and flavourful soup chock full of meat, starchy vegetables and chewy dumplings. Like most Jamaican soups, Red Pea Soup is more like a stew. It’s a main meal not a starter soup or one you’d have with salad or sandwich. Red Pea Soup sticks to your ribs and satisfies.
	</p>
	<p><em>Note</em>: This soup should be moderately thick, but if it is too thick add some boiling water.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	    <li>1 1/2 cups Dry red peas (kidney beans)</li>
	    <li>8-10 cups Water, approx.</li>
	    <li>1 lb Stewing beef</li>
	    <li>1 large piece Yellow yam</li>
	    <li>1 large Sweet potato</li>
	    <li>1 medium onion, chopped or 3 Stalks green onion, chopped</li>
	    <li>1 tsp Dried thyme or 3 stalks  fresh thyme</li>
	    <li>1 tsp Pimento seeds (optional)</li>
	    <li>1 (or 2) Scotch Bonnet pepper</li>
	    <li>1/2 tsp Black pepper</li>
	    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Dumplings</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>Dumplings</li>
	    <li>1 cup flour</li>
	    <li>1/3 cup water</li>
	    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
	    <li>Mix together to make stiff dough</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Overnight Prep</h3>
	<p>Place dry kidney beans in large soup pot on stove, cover with water and soak overnight</p>

	<h2>Steps</h2>

	<h3>Tip #1</h3>
	<p>
	    When peeling a yellow yam, make sure to avoid letting it touch your skin. The starch in the yam will make your skin itch so I suggest holding it with a tea towel or paper towel when peeling
	</p>
	<h3>Tip #2</h3>
	<p>
	    When it’s necessary to add more water to the simmering soup, use boiling water to keep the cooking temperature of the soup stable
	</p>

	<ol id="steps">
	    <li> <p>Place stewing beef in pot with red peas and add enough water to cover the two ingredients. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer for about 1 hour, or until peas and beef are cooked. </p>
		<ul>
		    <li><em>Note</em>: the beef will likely be cooked before the peas, so remove when tender.</li>
		    <li><em>Note</em>: In both pots, as water evaporates when cooking, add boiling water to cover ingredients.</li>
		</ul>
	    </li>

	    <li>Peel and cut yam and sweet potato into large serving pieces; add to boiling soup. Add boiling water to pot to semi cover yams and potatoes.</li>

	    <li>Make dumplings (see above) and add to boiling pot of soup.</li>

	    <li>Add onion, thyme, pimento, Scotch Bonnet pepper and black pepper to soup pot and simmer until yams and potatoes are tender and soup has thickened.</li>

	    <li>Taste soup for flavour and add salt or pepper, if needed.</li>

	</ol>
